# OpenVine
A camera for 6s short-form video clips, inspired by the old-school [Vine app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_(service)).

It records only while you keep the red button pressed. After 6 s have been recorded, it stitches all the clips together into a single video file.

This is really just a camera app, there is no external server component. Videos are only stored locally, but can be forwarded to instant messengers or social networks by Androids built in _share_ functionality.

# Bugs
  * The selfie camera records upside-down. The workaround is to turn your phone by 180 degrees before recording with the selfie camera 🤣

# Download
The app is available on F-Droid (once approved) and under [Releases](https://github.com/michael-betz/OpenVine/releases) as a signed .apk file.
